For a pipeline of preprocessing and analysis steps to take please see either
* PF_Analysis_VRnoVR      (Virtual Reality screens on versus screens off)
* PF_Analysis_AllSetups   (Virtual Reality, Linear Track, Open Field)

Each script is arranged as followed:
1) Run preprocessing steps - only to be done one time
2) Each section of the script may be run independently - after running the section labeled 'define and load mat files' for that specific section.
